# About Myself
My name is steevy, and as long as i remember tech and computers have always been fascinating to me. I was introduced to it by my father, doing stuff in an Atari St in the living room. Well, mainly playing amazing video games. For my sixth birthday, my parents bought me a little computer for kids, but it was amazing. I learnt to type in it, with little video games that drop words and you have to type them as fast as you can. And there was a Basic editor, where i learnt a little about coding. 
Twenty-four years later, i still didn't make science computer my main field in life. I was too busy experiencing the world, traveling, learning, loving. But i have to make choices for the future now that i'm at the beggining of my 30s. So i picked psychology and programming, as it's my main to passion in life. So here it beggins.
